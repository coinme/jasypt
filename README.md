# jaysypt

This project is not found on maven central, so must be cloned and installed separately.

The tests do not pass in this build, which I inherited from the parent fork. I do not have the time to investigate, so am ignoring for now.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coinme/jasypt.git
cd jaysypt
mvn install -DskipTests=true
```
